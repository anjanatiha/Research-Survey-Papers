# A Survey on Application of Cloud Computing for Sensor Network

A sensor network consists of sensors that spread out several hundred instances,which sample the physical
data of the environment. The data is stored temporarily in local nodes and transmitted to the sink
node.This new network can deliver several applications that create valued services for consumers. Cloud
computing renders publicly available, elastic and dynamic computing architecture.Users can freely select
various levels of cloud platforms from Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS)
to Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).The scalable computing power for data analysis, active application
development tools and a virtually infinite capacity for storage make cloud computing technically alluring
for sensor data integration. The parsing and processing of data is very easy.Cloud also acts as a library
with elastic capacity in which users only need to put effort in developing the application features while
underlying structure is hidden. Geographically distributed data centers ensure data safety by programming
regular replication of data to a different data center.
